            'lack of confidence in her plans for reform. More than 31,000 '
            'rank-and-file officers are represented by the Met Police '
            'Federation. Chairman Ken Marsh warned that the atmosphere among '
            'Met Police officers was at "rock bottom". Writing in the Observer '
            'on Sunday,  Mr Khan said he was "deeply concerned" public trust '
            'in the force had been "shattered". He said the next commissioner '
            'needed to make things change quickly. In response to the Met '
            "Police Federation's comments, Mr Khan said he stood by his views, "
            'insisting it was his job to "stand up for Londoners". Mr Marsh '
            'said that remarks made by the mayor had "undermined the '
            'professional, dedicated and incredibly difficult work of tens of '
            'thousands of hard-working and brave police officers from across '
            'the capital". "We have let the mayor\'s office know in no '
            'uncertain terms how our brave and diligent colleagues deserve '
            'better," Mr Marsh said. "Officers in London feel saddened and '
            'angry that the commissioner, Cressida Dick, has been pushed out '
            'in the way she has. "She was reforming. She was changing. The '
            'culture is changing. "We are deeply disappointed with the actions '
            'of the mayor." Dame Cressida\'s resignation followed a series of '
            'crises engulfing the Met Police, including cases of sexism and '
            'misogyny among some officers. Last week,  the police watchdog '
            'found  "disgraceful" examples of bullying and sexual harassment '
            'at Charing Cross police station in central London.  This video '
            "can not be played Reacting to Mr Marsh's comments, the mayor said "
            'a change of leadership was "the only way to address" a crisis of '
            'trust. A spokesman for Mr Khan added: "The mayor has always made '
            'clear that there are thousands of incredibly brave and decent '
            'police officers at the Met, who we owe a huge debt of gratitude.  '
            '"But the series of scandals seen in recent years has tarnished '
            'the reputation of the police, which is so crucial to policing by '
            'consent.  "Downplaying the scale of the change required is only '
            'going to hinder, not help, the vital process of restoring '
            'Londoners\' trust in the Met."  The mayor is due to work with '
            'Home Secretary Priti Patel to find a replacement for Dame '
            'Cressida. While the home secretary holds the power over the '
            "appointment, she must take the Labour mayor's views into "

2022-02-14 17:10:53 [scrapy.core.scraper] ERROR: Error processing {'content': 'Evesham Rugby Club player Jack Jeffery, 27, was taken to hospital '
            'after being injured in the seniors league game against Berkswell '
            'and Balsall on Saturday. His father Glenn said he died "doing '
            'what he loved the most, playing rugby". Club chairman Dave '
            'Summerfield said the players were reeling as "it was such a '
            'terrible shock". Glenn Jeffery posted on Facebook: "It is with '
            'great sadness that I need to let you know we lost our beloved son '
            'Jack yesterday."  He described him as the "most kind hearted, '
            'generous and beautiful son who enriched the lives of everyone who '
            'was lucky to know and have met him". "He will be so missed by his '
            'family and friends," he said. A flag was flown at half-mast at '
            'Evesham Rugby Club as a mark of respect for the "extremely '
            'popular player", Mr Summerfield said.  He said the accident had '
            '"affected the players greatly", adding: "As a club, we have been '
            'overwhelmed by the messages of support and goodwill from the '
            'rugby community. "Jack was calm, respected and highly thought of. '
            'Our club and community have lost such a bright light." A '
            "statement on the club's website said Mr Jeffery, who lived in "
            'London, was "adding another try to his phenomenal record" and was '
            'injured in an accident on the pitch as he scored. "He would often '
            'return from London for training and was always at the heart of '
            'club activities," it added. "He served his club, his teammates '
            'and the county with distinction and provided much satisfaction to '
            'the club supporters in knowing exactly where the whitewash [try '
            'line] was." Premiership side Worcester Warriors tweeted a message '
            'of condolence to his family, friends and teammates. 😢 The '
            'thoughts of all at Sixways are with the family, friends and '
            'team-mates of  @EveshamRFC  player Jack Jeffery who tragically '

2022-02-14 17:10:57 [scrapy.core.scraper] ERROR: Error processing {'content': 'The victim, who was sleeping in a tent in Manchester city centre, '
            'woke up to find a man assaulting her in August 2020. She said she '
            'reported it but officers did not take formal statements. The BBC '
            'has contacted GMP for a response. The woman said officers spoke '
            'to her briefly in the back of a patrol car after she reported the '
            'assault. Her representative Nicola Bailey-Gibbs, from Hudgell '
            'Solicitors, said officers reviewed CCTV footage but did not take '
            'any formal statements from the homeless woman or her partner, who '
            'was a witness, and no other potential witnesses were interviewed. '
            'Shortly afterwards, the woman said she discussed the attack with '
            'other homeless women when four others said they had also '
            'experienced a similar assault. Ms Bailey-Gibbs said formal '
            'statements should have been taken from all five women and other '
            'CCTV footage should have been reviewed. She said the attacks '
            '"should not have been treated as minor offences". "They were a '
            'series of disturbing sexual assaults that should have prompted '
            'concern among officers whose job it is to protect the public, '
            'whoever they may be and whatever circumstances they find '
            'themselves in." Ms Bailey-Gibbs warned this could have been a '
            'serial sex attacker and ignoring sexual assaults could have '
            '"catastrophic consequences".  Recent data  showed that about '
            '773,000 people suffered sex assaults in England and Wales in the '
            'year ending March 2020, with nearly four times more female '
            'victims than male victims.  The Crime Survey for England and '
            'Wales reports that about 16% of female rape victims and 19% of '
            'male victims - aged between 16 and 59 - reported it to police. '

2022-02-14 17:15:21 [scrapy.core.scraper] ERROR: Error processing {'content': "She resigned from the role on Thursday over the mayor of London's "
            'lack of confidence in her plans for reform. More than 31,000 '
            'rank-and-file officers are represented by the Met Police '
            'Federation. Chairman Ken Marsh warned that the atmosphere among '
            'Met Police officers was at "rock bottom". Writing in the Observer '
            'on Sunday,  Mr Khan said he was "deeply concerned" public trust '
            'in the force had been "shattered". He said the next commissioner '
            'needed to make things change quickly. In response to the Met '
            "Police Federation's comments, Mr Khan said he stood by his views, "
            'insisting it was his job to "stand up for Londoners". Mr Marsh '
            'said that remarks made by the mayor had "undermined the '
            'professional, dedicated and incredibly difficult work of tens of '
            'thousands of hard-working and brave police officers from across '
            'the capital". "We have let the mayor\'s office know in no '
            'uncertain terms how our brave and diligent colleagues deserve '
            'better," Mr Marsh said. "Officers in London feel saddened and '

            'in the way she has. "She was reforming. She was changing. The '
            'culture is changing. "We are deeply disappointed with the actions '
            'of the mayor." Dame Cressida\'s resignation followed a series of '
            'crises engulfing the Met Police, including cases of sexism and '
            'misogyny among some officers. Last week,  the police watchdog '
            'found  "disgraceful" examples of bullying and sexual harassment '
            'at Charing Cross police station in central London.  This video '
            "can not be played Reacting to Mr Marsh's comments, the mayor said "
            'a change of leadership was "the only way to address" a crisis of '
            'trust. A spokesman for Mr Khan added: "The mayor has always made '
            'clear that there are thousands of incredibly brave and decent '
            'police officers at the Met, who we owe a huge debt of gratitude.  '
            '"But the series of scandals seen in recent years has tarnished '
            'the reputation of the police, which is so crucial to policing by '

            'going to hinder, not help, the vital process of restoring '
            'Londoners\' trust in the Met."  The mayor is due to work with '

            'Cressida. While the home secretary holds the power over the '

2022-02-14 17:15:26 [scrapy.core.scraper] ERROR: Error processing {'content': 'Director general Tim Davie said Write Across would be piloted in '
            'Liverpool, before similar projects were rolled out across the '
            'UK.  He said Liverpool was picked because it was "a city of '
            'stories". Tony Schumacher, who wrote the recent Liverpool-set '
            'drama The Responder, welcomed the initiative. He said starting a '
            'writing career was "hard and it\'s difficult to know where to '
            'begin". "A scheme like Write Across Liverpool is exactly what you '
            'need as a new writer to help guide you through your development," '
            'he said.  "It\'s great the BBC and its partners are doing this in '
            'Liverpool." A BBC spokeswoman said the scheme was an eight-week '
            'development programme to give aspiring writers an insight into '
            'writing for TV and would see the broadcaster partner with a '
            'number of organisations in the city, including the Liverpool Film '
            'Office and the Everyman, Playhouse, Royal Court and Unity '
            'theatres.  She said up to 15 writers would be invited to take '
            'part and the programme would cover storytelling for the screen '
            'with masterclasses from screenwriters, producers and '
            'commissioners. Mr Davie said Liverpool was "the natural place to '
            'launch a scheme like this, because it is a city of stories". '
            '"When you look at the writing talent that has emerged from '
            'Liverpool over the years, it\'s quite extraordinary," he said. '
            '"Our aim... is to find and develop the people who will be writing '
            "BBC One dramas in five years' time and I'm confident we will do "
            'that given the creativity and talent in Liverpool." Liverpool '
            "City Council's Harry Doyle, the cabinet member responsible for "
            'Liverpool Film Office, said the authority was "delighted" that '
            'the city had been chosen to pilot the project. "Liverpool is a '
            'hotbed of creative talent," he said. "We\'re lucky to be home to '
            'inspirational writers such as Jimmy McGovern, Helen Blakeman and '
            'Tony Schumacher, and we know there is a huge amount of untapped '
            'talent here." He added that those picked for the scheme would '
            '"massively benefit" from it and hopefully get "a foot in the door '
            'of the TV industry". Those interested in joining the programme '

            'has been given a three-year sentence. Dylan McEwan, 19, who '
            'styled himself as MC McEwan and the B-Town Grafter, was involved '
            'in the thefts of four cars from homes in Leeds. In a mobile phone '
            'clip found by police, McEwan launches into a rap where he brags '
            'of "getting paid out for brand new cars". He pleaded guilty to '
            'burglary and car theft charges at Leeds Crown Court. McEwan and '
            'two younger accomplices stole four vehicles from two houses in '
            'Pudsey and Bramley last December. Christmas presents were also '
            'stolen during one of the raids. Officers discovered the rap video '
            'after the trio were arrested following a police pursuit through '
            'Bradford. In the clip, McEwan is seen driving as the caption "big '
            'whips" - slang for an expensive car - flashes up on screen. After '
            'encouragement from two passengers, he starts rapping, referring '
            'to himself as the B-Town Grafter. "I creep through your yard. '
            'Getting paid out for your brand new cars," he says. "But I can\'t '
            'lie," he continues, and goes on to opine that "graft life" - his '
            'criminal existence - is "hard". "Spend half your time sitting '
            'behind bars," he adds. McEwan, of Barncroft Drive, Seacroft, was '
            'sentenced alongside his accomplices, who cannot be named due to '
            'their age, on 4 February. All three admitted two counts each of '
            'burglary and car theft. The younger defendants were each given '
            'community rehabilitation orders. Det Insp Vicky Vessey, of Leeds '
            'District Crime Team, said McEwan had "brought misery to his '
            'victims who have had to suffer the indignity of having their '
            'homes invaded and their property stolen. "The utter disdain he '
            'has for the people he targets to steal from is abundantly clear '
            'from the lyrics in his social media post." Follow BBC Yorkshire '

            'pandemic posed and looking ahead to when audiences return. Tom '
            'Paine, from Team Love which runs Bristol music festival Love '
            'Saves The Day, said the biggest challenge during the pandemic was '
            'uncertainty. Love Saves The Day 2020 was due to take place in '
            'May, but two months earlier the country went into full lockdown. '
            'The festival asked to put the event back to September but, as Mr '
            'Paine said, "later in the summer it became clear festivals just '
            'weren\'t going to happen". "These shows can take nine months of '
            'planning," he said.  "People were looking to the government for '
            'advice but to be fair to them they were in an almost impossible '
            'position because they didn\'t know what guidance to give." In '
            '2021 a rise in infections meant Love Saves The Day was once again '
            'postponed from May to September and this time the event was able '
            'to go ahead - with added safety restrictions. Mr Paine said the '
            'presence of so many festivals in the West helped during the low '
            'moments. "Bristol and the West is a great place to be in terms of '
            "support from the rest of the industry, we've got great organisers "
            'like the people behind Boomtown and Shambala, so we were on the '
            'phone to each other a lot. "We also had a lot of support from the '
            'Association of Independent Festivals." Although his team have '
            'faced two years of disruption and worry, Mr Paine said they were '
            'approaching the summer of 2022 with huge excitement. This year '
            'his long-held dream of holding the festival at Ashton Court '
            'should come true, over the Bank Holiday weekend of 2-3 June. "As '
            "the days get longer and warmer I think we're going to feel a real "
            'growing excitement.  "Come April and May I think people will '
            'start talking and thinking about festivals again," said Mr Paine. '
            '"Those shared experiences, those really big events, were taken '
            'away from all of us during lockdown and I think there is now a '
            'newfound appreciation for them." After two years of being on hold '
            'or finding ways to hold events in a socially-distanced world, '
            "many of Bristol's big hitters have already said they will be "
            'returning with a bang. The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, '
            'Upfest, Bristol Harbour Festival, Dot to Dot, Bristol Pride, '
            'Bristol Craft Beer Festival, Bristol Light Festival, Bristol '
            'Sounds, Mayfest and Hopyard are among those to have confirmed '
            'dates. Simon Clarke is part of the team that runs the Shindig '
            'Festival in Somerset. A lot has changed over the course of the '
            'pandemic, he said, and not all of it was good. "It\'s been hard '
            'to keep a team together, employees, contractors.  "We\'ve come '
            'out the other side and have been literally phoning around to see '
            'if people are still in business. "That\'s tough when a whole '
            'company you have worked with and relied on for years just '
            'disappears. "It\'s costing us a lot more money, fees have gone up '
            'generally in the events industry, there are fewer people to '
            'choose from so rates have risen. "I\'ve heard of some contractors '
            'doubling their prices." Despite the financial challenges, Mr '
            "Clarke said he expected this year's Shindig Festival, from 26 to "
            '29 May, to be "special". "There\'s a real buzz," he said. "People '
            'have waited to see these acts for two years. Ours is a small '
            'festival and a lot of people know each other and I think they '
            'can\'t wait to meet up again. "There are also fewer tickets '
            'around in general.  "Glastonbury and Shambala and the other big '
            'festivals sold out in 2020, so people are having to think about '
            'smaller events like ours. "I think people cannot wait to let '
            'their hair down." The city-wide Bath Festival, which combines '
            'music and literature, is also returning this year. Other Somerset '
            'events that have confirmed they will be going ahead in 2022 '
            'include the Weston Air Festival, Valley Fest, NASS, Priddy Folk '
            'Festival, Pub in the Park and ArcTanGent. Helen Taylor, external '
            'relations director at Wiltshire Creative which runs the Salisbury '
            'International Arts Festival, said it had been "devastating" to '
            'cancel the event early in 2020. "I was talking to some supporters '
            'the other day and we realised the last big event any of us went '
            'to was the launch event in 2020, then we went into lockdown not '
            'long afterwards," she said. In 2021, it was still not possible to '
            'run the festival in its usual format, but there were plenty of '
            'online and socially-distanced events in the city. Now, with '
            'tickets for the 2022 festival going on sale on 15 March Miss '
            'Taylor said it was "wildly exciting" to be counting down to the '
            'full festival once again. "I really think it\'s going to be like '
            'a phoenix rising from the ashes. "It\'s also nerve-wracking '
            'because you look across the industry and see that audiences have '
            'been slightly slow to return, they\'ve got out of the habit," she '
            'added. "We really need them to come back and buy those tickets '
            'and experience what\'s been a year\'s worth of planning for us." '
            'Miss Taylor said the pandemic had had an impact on programming '
            "for this year's expanded festival, which will run from 27 May to "
            '18 June, and created a desire to work with different communities. '
            '"We\'ve got the Bath Philharmonia coming, and they\'re working '
            'with Wiltshire Young Carers. "We are also taking events up to '
            "Bemerton Heath [estate], we're having a beach party day which is "
            "free, and we'll do the same out at Tidworth for the military "
            'community there." Womad, the UK\'s biggest world music event, is '
            'also going ahead in Wiltshire in the summer, starting on 28 July. '
            'But not every event is returning.  Organisers of the Larmer Tree '
            'Festival near Salisbury have already called it off, citing '
            'financial issues caused by Covid-19. It said it hoped to return '
            'in 2023. Another big Wiltshire Festival, End of the Road, will be '
            'going ahead in September. The Gloucester Tall Ships Festival, '
            'which brings thousands of people to the docks in the city centre, '
            "will be held again this summer, over the Queen's Platinum Jubilee "
            'Weekend from 3-5 June. On the same weekend, the Wychwood '
            'Festival, headlined by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Deacon Blue, will '

            '22% of autistic adults are in any kind of employment. Cafe '
            'founder Nic Lander said: "There\'s a lot of barriers out there '
            'and we\'re just trying to break those down. "We\'re trying to '
            'help people with their social confidence and get them into work." '
            'Last December, the  government announced a new package of '
            'support  to help thousands of disabled people into work as part '
            'of their Build Back Fairer initiative. Minister for disabled '
            'people, Chloe Smith, said 15 Jobcentre Plus sites would trial a '
            'new framework, designed with the NAS, to make the service more '
            'accessible to jobseekers on the autism spectrum.  She added that '
            '26,000 work coaches in jobcentres across the country would also '
            'undergo specialist accessibility training. Mr Lander has '
            'first-hand experience of living with autism - his three daughters '
            'have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD '
            '(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). With three '
            'neurodivergent daughters, he created the Kimel Foundation last '
            'year over concerns about the number of autistic people in '
            'employment. And he hopes creating the social enterprise cafe will '
            'help get young neurodivergent people into employment. "There\'s a '
            'job for everyone out there," he says, adding: "They may do things '
            'slightly differently or at a different pace, but give them an '
            'opportunity to thrive." Tim Nicholls, the NAS\'s head of policy, '
            'said its figures were "absolutely shocking".  "Too many autistic '
            'people face barriers at almost every step in their journey '
            'towards or in work. "Things like work trials can give you a much '
            "better indication of whether they're the right fit for that "
            'job," he said. "When someone is in a job and in the workplace, '
            'understanding and knowing what autism is, is absolutely crucial '

            'Umair Zaheer, 34, to target those responsible. Zaheer, known as '
            "Assassin's Creed on EncroChat, sent a list of firearms, "
            'ammunition and other accessories for sale to Bilal Khan, 33, who '
            'was known as Legend Killer, the NCA said. The firearms included '

            'added international artists were postponing gigs, "decimating" '
            'its diary. "It will be difficult to get more money out of the '
            'Treasury," said Conservative MP Siobhan Baillie. However, she '
            'said music venues were "genuinely valued by government and '
            'important to our economy". The West Country\'s biggest nightclub, '
            'Motion, a warehouse with a capacity of 4,000, was closed for 16 '
            'months through the pandemic. Managing director Dan Deeks said '
            'they were still overstaffing events in order to keep within the '
            "venue's licence agreement, which determines how many security and "
            'medical staff are needed at any one time. "Obviously in some '
            "cases we don't need that overstaffing because people aren't off "
            'ill and there\'s a huge extra cost to that," he added. Exchange, '
            'a much smaller venue, said international artists, which bring in '
            'the most money, were pulling events or postponing until spring. '
            '"People don\'t want to put deposits down on the flights to come '
            "to the UK because it's a big financial risk to then find out they "
            'can\'t come because they get coronavirus," said manager Matt '
            'Otridge. All coronavirus restrictions were lifted in England on '
            '27 January, leaving establishments to decide on their own rules. '
            'Both Exchange and Motion are continuing to ask their staff to '
            'wear face coverings and asking people to take a lateral flow test '
            'before arriving. Mr Otridge said: "We (also) ask the public to '
            'wear masks. We have a very big emphasis on people testing '
            'themselves prior to coming to the event. We offer refunds if '
            'people feel ill." He said the venue had also made a "significant '
            'investment" in purchasing UVC disinfection units which were '
            'fitted throughout the venue. Mr Deeks said businesses like theirs '
            'contributed to the culture and economy of the UK, but needed more '
            'funding to help them stay afloat. "We\'d like support for our '
            "staff. That's the one thing that is a real problem for us at the "
            'moment. "Throughout December there was a huge amount of staff '
            'that we overbooked but when the government told people not to go '
            'out, those staff were surplus to our needs. "This is constantly '
            'going to be a push and pull situation when really we need '
            'certainty." Before the pandemic the live music industry was worth '
            'about £4.5bn a year to the British economy.  Carly Heath, '
            "Bristol's Night Time Economy Advisor, said about 91,000 people "
            'work in the sector within the city. "It\'s enormously valuable. '
            'The night time is where we meet our friends and we get together '
            'with our community," she added. The chancellor\'s £1bn support '
            'package for businesses, announced late last year, included '
            'one-off grants of up to £6,000, which the  Music Venue Trust  '
            'called a ""woefully inadequate response".  "I mean, £6,000 to a '
            "business like ours is not a lot of money, if I'm completely "
            'honest," said Mr Deeks. "When you\'re talking about businesses '
            "that were losing on average about £45,000 a weekend it doesn't "
            'even scratch the surface in terms of retaining jobs and making '
            'sure that the venues are financially stable," added Ms Heath. Ms '
            'Baillie, the MP for Stroud, said: "I found I had to really go in '
            'to bat for these venues during the pandemic because there seemed '
            'to be a real lack of understanding of how the businesses are run '
            'and the impact of the closures we saw during lockdown. "I think '
            'it will be difficult to get more money out of the Treasury but I '
            "think it's absolutely worth making the case and constantly asking "
            'for that support." She pointed out that the government had also '
            'provided the furlough schemes, business rates cuts and other ways '
            'of supporting the events industry during the pandemic.  A '
            'spokesperson for HM Treasury said: "We\'ve supported businesses '
            'throughout the pandemic through our nearly £400 billion package '
            'of support, and will continue to do so. "As well as £1bn in new '
            'grants support, businesses are still benefitting from a 75% cut '
            'in business rates over the year, reduced VAT, eviction '
            'protection, government-backed loans, Time to Pay and our '

            'at her home in Portland Street, Boston, on 14 July. Giving '
            'evidence Ms Stevenson said she had reached for the weapon after '
            'Mr Higgs attacked her following a row and he had pulled the blade '
            'towards himself. The defendant, who is on trial at Lincoln Crown '
            'Court, denies murder. Prosecutors allege Mr Higgs, 21, died from '
            'a single stab wound to the heart "deliberately inflicted" by Ms '
            'Stevenson. However, the defendant claims he pulled the knife '
            'towards himself after strangling her. Ms Stevenson told the court '
            'Mr Higgs had confronted her in the kitchen after a row. "I was '
            'trying to push him off, [but] he just lost control and started '
            'attacking me, punching me in the head, and started strangling '
            'me," she said. The court heard the couple, who had a child '
            'together, had a "history of violence", and the defendant had '
            'picked up a knife on a previous occasion during a "physical row". '
            'Asked by defence barrister James Newton-Price QC why she picked '
            'it up during the previous incident, Ms Stevenson replied: "To '
            'scare Christopher away." "He was shocked and stopped straight '
            'away," Ms Stevenson said. Asked why she again picked up a knife '
            'in the incident that led to his death, she replied: "To scare '
            'him." She claimed Mr Higgs had her in a headlock when she picked '
            'up the weapon, saying: "I was scared and wanted him to get off '
            'me". Ms Stevenson said Mr Higgs had then put his hand on hers and '
            'pulled the knife towards him before "something bad happened". The '
            'court previously heard that Ms Stevenson had  called 999 for an '
            'ambulance    and told the call handler "my boyfriend has just run '
            'into the house [and] he\'s landed on a knife". The trial '

            'against a boy and the attempted rape of a young girl. The abuse '
            'happened in Rotherham when he was a teenager, Sheffield Crown '
            'Court heard. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Lavender said his '
            'actions had had "profound and lifelong effects" on the victims. '
            'The court heard Lord Ahmed, who was tried under his birth name '
            'Nazir Ahmed, attempted to rape the girl twice in the early 1970s, '
            'when he was aged 16 or 17 but she was much younger. The attack on '
            'the boy, who was aged under 11 at the time, also happened during '
            'the same period. The 64-year-old had denied the charges, calling '
            'them a "malicious fiction", but a phone recording of a '
            'conversation between the two victims in 2016 showed they were not '
            '"made-up". The judge said the offences were "so serious that only '
            'a custodial sentence can be justified". He said: "Your actions '
            'have had profound and lifelong effects on the girl and the boy, '
            'who have lived with what you did to them for between 46 and 53 '
            'years.  "The statements which they have made express more '
            'eloquently than I ever could how your actions have affected and '
            'continue to affect their lives in so many different and damaging '
            'ways." The victim of the attempted rapes, who cannot be named due '
            'to the nature of the offences, said she had lived with "an '
            'overwhelming feeling of shame". She told the court: "It was a '
            'burden I was made to carry, and it silenced me for many years. '
            '"It is now time for me to pass that burden to him - the '
            'paedophile who I know feels no personal shame." The male victim, '
            'who also cannot be named, said in a personal statement read out '
            'in court: "I buried the abuse and carried it with me on my own '
            'for years and years. "I feel shame because of what these men did '
            'to me." In court number seven at Sheffield Crown Court today, '
            'both the judge and defendant could technically be addressed as '
            '"my Lord", "your Lordship" or any other variation of the title. '
            'Lord Ahmed sat in the dock wearing a smart suit and tie, '
            'listening to barristers and a judge discuss his sentence. One '
            'victim came to the witness box to describe the impact the peer of '
            'the realm had on her life. "He is a paedophile who has no '
            'personal shame. But in the end, all tyrants fall," she said. A '
            'statement from the second victim said: "This is not about '
            'revenge, this is about justice." And part of that justice is '
            'wanting to see Lord Ahmed stripped of his title and known '
            "forthwith by his real name, Nazir Ahmed. They don't want him to "
            'use his title to impress anyone again. The judge told him his '
            'actions had a profound and lifelong effect on his victims. He '
            'stood to listen to the judge but showed no emotion. Shortly '
            'afterwards, Ahmed picked up his rucksack, waved at his family and '
            'disappeared through a door to start his five-and-a-half year '
            'sentence. Ahmed, who was convicted following a retrial, resigned '
            'from the House of Lords in November 2020 after a conduct '
            'committee report concluded he had sexually and emotionally '
            'exploited a vulnerable woman who sought his help. The inquiry '
            'into his behaviour followed a BBC Newsnight investigation. There '
            'have been calls for him to be stripped of his title. This would '
            'require an Act of Parliament but none currently exists. Ahmed was '
            'charged along with his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, '
            'and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both were deemed unfit to stand '
            'trial. Both had faced charges of indecent assault against the '
            'same boy abused by Ahmed. Though the men did not face a criminal '
            'trial, jurors concluded that they did commit the alleged acts '
            'after hearing evidence in the case. Both men were given absolute '
            'discharges after the judge said the only other two options - a '
            'hospital order or a supervision order - would not be appropriate '
            'in this case. Sarah Champion, Labour MP for Rotherham, paid '
            'tribute to the "courage, bravery and determination of the '
            'victims". She said: "The verdict in this case sends a clear '
            'message to offenders: no matter your power or your status, '
            'justice will be served, however long it is eluded. "The fact Mr '
            'Ahmed is able to retain his peerage makes a mockery of our '
            'honours system. I urge the government to bring forward '

            'with the earth scientist. Francis pleaded guilty to causing the '
            'death of Mr Brown by careless driving. The 33-year-old was '
            'sentenced to 12 months, suspended for two years. Prosecutor '
            'Michael Shaw said Francis had been working late with two '

            'into contact with the windscreen and he suffered a severe head '
            'injury." Francis, from Tongham, Surrey, carried out chest '

            'He was 23 years of age." In mitigation, Edmund Gritt issued an '

            'the UK from Africa each spring to breed but their numbers have '
            'fallen by more than half in 25 years. Eddie Bathgate has 14 '
            'nesting boxes on his home in Woodbridge, some of which he hopes '
            'will be home to swifts this summer.  Mr Bathgate, of the Suffolk '
            'Bird Group, said the species was "rapidly declining" and said a '
            'loss of nesting sites through "renovations and refurbishment '
            'works" was primarily to blame.  He said the birds liked to come '
            'back to the same nesting sites year after year.  Swifts have a '
            'short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a '
            'crescent or a boomerang. They can fly at 69 mph (111 km/h),  '
            'making them the fastest recorded birds at level height. The '
            'estimated average population fell by more than 50% in the UK '
            'between 1995 and 2016, from 125,500 to 59,000. Mr Bathgate said '
            'anyone putting up a box should meet certain conditions to give '
            'nesting pairs and young fledglings the best chance of survival.  '
            'He said: "Swifts boxes need to be at first-floor window height '
            'with a clear line of flight so the birds can drop out of the nest '
            'box. The young swifts when they fledge late July, early August, '
            'will not land for another 18 months so that first flight is '
            'essential." Committing to regularly playing a swift call between '
            'May and July through a machine attached to the box was also '
            'essential, he said.  He said: "Swifts are curious. They react to '
            'sound calls and will investigate any prospect for a future nest '
            'site. The idea is to attract year one and two birds to attract '

            'Dan Wootton, including messages branding him a sex offender and '
            'murderer. Sheffield Crown Court heard Brady had admitted '
            'harassing the GB News presenter between February and April last '
            'year. Brady, a former Apprentice contestant, was jailed for four '
            'months. The court heard how he started harassing Mr Wootton, a '
            'Daily Mail columnist and former executive editor of The Sun, '
            "around a year after  Miss Flack's death on 15 February 2020 . He "
            'had faced more serious allegations of putting Mr Wootton in fear '
            'of violence, but changed his plea to admit an alternative, lesser '
            'charge of harassment. Passing sentence, Judge Jeremy Richardson '
            'QC told Brady his claims that Mr Wootton was in some way '
            'responsible for Miss Flack\'s death were "wholly irrational", '
            'noting that Mr Wootton was actually a friend of the Love Island '
            'presenter. He told Brady the attacks on Mr Wootton had '
            '"everything to do with your craving for celebrity status and your '
            'irritation that the press were not in the least interested in '
            'your somewhat uninteresting life". The judge described some of '
            'Brady\'s comments as "utterly outrageous". Brady, from Sheffield, '
            'admitted using social media and video platforms to cause distress '
            'by: Judge Richardson also imposed a 10-year restraining order '
            'banning Brady from contacting Mr Wootton, posting anything about '
            'him online, or going within 200 yards of his home or workplace. '
            '"You must move on with your life," the judge told him. In a '
            'statement read to the court, Mr Wootton - who watched the '
            'proceedings by video-link - said he "adored" the "late, great '
            'Caroline Flack". He said he had a close working relationship with '
            'her, and added: "I only ever wrote stories about Caroline that '
            'she wanted to be published." "She knew I had her back," he added. '
            'Mr Wootton said the late presenter called him after ending her '
            'relationship with Brady, who had appeared on The Apprentice and '
            'Celebrity Big Brother, in 2018. Mr Wootton said in his statement: '
            '"The public should be aware that he [Brady] has no credibility to '
            'speak on behalf of Caroline." However, he added: "I hope he gets '
            'the help he needs." Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said other '
            "journalists were included in the defendant's messaging, including "
            'one who said Brady had demanded she pay him £40,000 for a "tell '
            'all" story about his former fiancée. She said Brady also made '
            'numerous attempts to sell stories about himself. Ms Marshall said '
            'one message Brady posted about Mr Wootton said: "Felt like '
            'getting rid of him once and for all." A voice message left for Mr '
            'Wootton included comments like: "You are culpable for people\'s '
            'deaths" and "you are an evil man who needs to be dealt with". '
            'Brady was arrested and bailed in February 2021 but continued his '
            'campaign against the journalist, the court was told. When he was '
            'arrested again, in April 2021, Brady livestreamed the event on '
            'Instagram, saying: "You\'re going to have to put a bullet in my '
            'head." Judge Richardson said he would not "sully" his sentencing '
            'remarks by repeating some of the "kaleidoscope of invective laced '
            'with high-octane expletives". "Put simply, you must stop doing '
            'what you do," he said, adding if Brady resumed his campaign, he '
            'faced a prison sentence measured in years rather than months. '

            'carriageway in West Sussex on 22 August 2015, killing 11 men. Mr '
            'Hill was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019. The '
            'Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) had opposed using the '
            'footage at the inquest. The AAIB inquiry concluded that the crash '
            'could have been avoided and was caused by pilot error when Mr '
            'Hill flew too low and too slowly while carrying out a manoeuvre. '
            "At his Old Bailey trial, Mr Hill's defence raised the issue of "
            'whether he had suffered a cognitive impairment which caused him '
            'to fly the plane in the manner he did. Part of the evidence '
            "produced was the video from the cockpit recorded on Mr Hill's "
            'Go-Pro camera. After the trial, the AAIB reviewed their '
            'investigation and concluded there was "no new and significant '
            'evidence of cognitive impairment" and that their findings were '
            'valid. The senior coroner for West Sussex, Penelope Schofield, '
            'had asked for the footage to assess whether a report from a '
            'doctor - a paediatric oncologist who is a friend of the pilot - '
            'could be evidence the AAIB probe was incomplete, flawed or '
            'deficient in considering cognitive impairment. Lawyers for the '
            'coroner had argued that the report made a credible suggestion the '
            "AAIB's investigation of cognitive impairment was incomplete, but "
            'said she did not have credible evidence. Mr Hill and the families '
            "of three of the men who died supported the coroner's request for "
            'the footage. The AAIB had argued that handing over the footage '
            'would have a "significant potential adverse impact on future '
            'safety investigations". The High Court had previously heard that '
            'cockpit recordings are protected from being disclosed unless '
            'being used in safety investigations. It was told the AAIB cannot '
            'compel people or organisations to co-operate with their inquiries '
            'and protecting material helps encourage people involved in air '
            'accidents to cooperate. In a judgment on Friday, two senior '
            'judges dismissed the bid. Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Mr '
            'Justice Saini, ruled there "is neither credible evidence nor, '

            '"The best way to describe Cheryl was cheeky and cute. She was '
            'always cheerful. Our little princess. She was also a rascal."  '
            "But, on 12 January 1970, the Grimmers' dreams fell apart. It's a "
            "boiling hot mid-summer's day. The accommodation huts are stifling "
            'and full of bugs. After lunch, Ricki begs his mum to take him and '
            'his three younger siblings down to Fairy Meadow beach for a '
            "refreshing splash in the sea.  At around two o'clock in the "
            'afternoon, the wind suddenly changes. Locals call it a "southerly '
            'buster". Sand blows everywhere. Families race to pack up and '
            "leave. The children's mum, Carol, tells Ricki to take his "
            'brothers and sister up to the changing block at the top of the '
            "beach and to wait for her there. It's only a short walk.  "
            "Three-year-old Cheryl runs giggling into the ladies' changing "
            'rooms. Ricki and his brothers are too embarrassed to follow her. '
            'So, after pleading with her to come out, they decide to go back '
            'to the beach to get their mum.  "It happened so fast. It took us '
            'about 90 seconds to find mum and bring her up to the shower '
            'block," Ricki remembers. "But, by the time we returned, there was '
            'no sign of Cheryl. She was there - and then she was gone. It was '
            'so quick.  "My mother looked around and then she started shaking '
            "me and shouting, 'Where did you leave her?' It went crazy after "
            'that. Everybody started calling out her name. There was panic. '
            'Complete chaos."  Despite one of the biggest searches in the '
            'history of New South Wales - involving thousands of police '
            'officers and soldiers - Cheryl was never found.  More than 50 '
            'years later, that single moment still dominates every aspect of '
            'Ricki\'s life: "Try putting yourself in my shoes. I\'m haunted by '
            'it. Consumed by it. I can still see her standing there, laughing '
            'and smiling. I still see her running up and down the shoreline. '
            'Those images will never go away."  Initially, I thought this '
            'story would make a short news bulletin piece. I had no idea how '
            'my investigation would develop into our  eight-part Fairy Meadow '
            "podcast . I've spent a lot of time listening to Ricki. He has "
            'told me how that single moment in his childhood has ruined the '
            'rest of his life. Flashbacks and nightmares still torment him. '
            'There have been broken marriages, fractured relationships with '
            'his kids and times when he has felt unable to carry on.  So what '
            'keeps him going?  "Before they died, I promised my mum and dad I '
            'would find Cheryl - or at least find out what happened to her. I '
            'will." As part of his quest for answers, Ricki has also come back '
            'to the UK. Back to the city of Bristol where he and his family '
            "lived before they emigrated to Australia. It's also the city "
            'where I live and work as a BBC reporter.  Here, in a hotel room, '
            'Ricki shows me a leather-bound journal which he keeps in his '
            'travel bag. It is filled with drawings and letters which he still '
            'writes to his missing sister every day. "My psychologist said it '
            'might help. I tell Cheryl about my life and what the family is up '
            'to. I ask her about her life. What she might be doing. I scribble '
            'little stick figures - trying to make sense of things. This book '
            'goes with me everywhere. Every plane trip. Every holiday. '
            'Everywhere. It never leaves my side. If I die, it dies with me." '
            'For Ricki, Bristol is a place where he feels he can maintain his '
            'connection with his sister. A place filled with memories from the '
            'time before she was taken. He shows me the small terraced house '
            'where the Grimmer children were born. He remembers their '
            'suitcases floating down the hallway in floodwater just before '
            'they headed to the New South Wales sunshine. He shows me the '
            'playground where he would push Cheryl on the swing.   Over the '
            'decades, the pain of losing his sister meant Ricki cut himself '
            'off. He tried to move on. He tried to forget. He refused to '
            'confront his past. But the reopening of the police investigation '
            'in 2016, the rediscovery of the confession and the case coming to '
            'court forced him to face things and mend some of the '
            'relationships he had ignored.  In a Bristol pub, he meets some of '
            "the English cousins he didn't speak to for years. Now close "
            'again, they tease him about his choice of Australian Shiraz, '
            'rather than local beer. Ricki updates them on his campaign for '
            'justice and thanks them for their continued support: "We can\'t '
            'let this go. We are going to keep fighting. We can never give '
            'up."  The disappointments and frustrations of the past few years '
            'have at least reunited the Grimmer family on both sides of the '
            "world. They hope the  New South Wales Government's recent offer  "
            'of a A$1m reward (£528,000) for information will persuade '
            'somebody to come forward.  Driving Ricki from Bristol to Heathrow '
            'Airport, to catch a flight back to Australia, he asks me if we '
            'can stop at a local cemetery for a few minutes.  In the far '
            'corner of this quiet, rural graveyard, beneath some pine trees, '
            'he shows me the Grimmer family plot where his grandparents are '
            'buried. Then, he tells me to look more closely. A small wooden '
            'sign has been nailed onto the headstone by one of his relatives. '
            'It says: "Cheryl Grimmer. Rest in Peace."  Ricki places some '
            'flowers on the grave. The ornamental teddy bear he left here on '
            'his last trip to Bristol has faded a little, but it makes him '
            'smile.  "It\'s nice to have somewhere to come. Somewhere to '
            'remember."  Listen to the Fairy Meadow podcast on BBC Sounds '

            '"Not many people say good things about Rhyl, which I can '

            'that, Carol opted to move into a larger shop on the high street '
            'three years ago. "I\'m very optimistic and over the last two or '
            "three years I have seen a change in Rhyl. I think it's an "
            'up-and-coming town again."   Such optimism is not always evident '
            'in the seaside town, which was struggling long before its economy '
            "was pounded by the pandemic. But Carol's act of faith may be "
            'repaid.   The local MP and the county council want to transform '
            'the town centre and recently prepared a £10m bid from the UK '
            "government's levelling up fund.   Money from the £4.8bn fund aims "
            'to narrow the gap between richer and poorer parts of the UK. It '
            'will allow overlooked and undervalued communities to take back '
            'control of their destiny, the levelling up minister, Michael '
            'Gove,  told parliament on Wednesday . But there are concerns that '
            'vital lessons from the past are being ignored.   A generation '
            'ago, West Newcastle was undergoing a radical plan for change. It '
            'was one of 39 English communities that received funds under '
            "Labour's New Deal for Communities (NDC). Within a few years "
            'levels of deprivation fell.  Graeme Williams ran the scheme and '
            'on a freezing cold January afternoon he gives us a tour of the '
            'area. We walk in shadows cast by the tower blocks of Cruddas '
            'Park, not far from the city centre. Twenty years ago "they looked '
            'awful", says Mr Williams. "They were awful." Some of the blocks '
            'were refurbished, others demolished as part of the £55m spent in '
            'West Newcastle during a decade of regeneration. But most of the '
            "money didn't go on capital projects, such as buildings.  His team "
            'appointed eight people who knew the area well to work with '
            'residents to prioritise what changes were needed. Decisions were '
            'taken by a management board made up mostly of residents.   The '
            'emphasis was "around training, education and supporting people to '
            'move into employment", says Mr Williams. "People recognised they '
            'had agency where they could actually generate change." It gave '
            'them hope.   An independent assessment of the New Deal for '
            'Communities by academics at Sheffield Hallam University concluded '
            '"in many respects these neighbourhoods have been transformed". It '
            'said: "The biggest improvements were for indicators of people\'s '
            'feelings about their neighbourhoods." Mr Williams still works in '
            'the city. He is now a director of the Centre West charity. And '
            'while proud of some of his achievements, he says a lot of work '
            'was "undone by austerity" which "hammered areas like the west end '
            'of Newcastle".  "It\'s massively disheartening and incredibly '
            'frustrating because we seem to take two steps forward and then '
            'two or three steps back as far as urban regeneration is '
            'concerned," he says. "There\'s an awful lot of really good '
            "evaluation work that's been done to identify what works and how "
            'we can do things better and it\'s not being used. "  Levelling up '
            '"might produce some nice shiny new buildings. But I don\'t think '
            'it will necessarily improve the lives and prospects of people '
            'living in them communities".  Supporters of what the Labour '
            'government policy achieved include a former Tory speech writer '
            'for Theresa May. Will Tanner, now director of the Onward think '
            'tank, assessed 60 years of regeneration projects by previous '
            'governments. "This isn\'t a party-political point. This is just '
            'about the right policy based on the evidence," he says.   He said '
            'putting power in the hands of communities worked best, "so they '
            'are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, rather than '
            'relying on a top-down government programme".  He says the '
            'government is right to want to change the economic geography of '
            'the UK and is supportive of its plans. But adds: "The most '
            'important thing for the levelling up fund to do is to let go of '
            'power from Whitehall and to empower community organisations right '
            'down at the hyper-local level."  The White Paper acknowledges the '
            'importance of local decision-making and promises more regional '
            "mayors. It isn't yet clear what role will be played by people at "
            'a neighbourhood level.  Back in Rhyl, we stroll around the town '
            'centre with Conservative MP James Davies, walking past boarded up '
            'and shuttered shops. He agrees. "Just building things, bricks and '
            'mortar is not the answer. It needs to be a cleverly thought '
            'through scheme that\'s going to boost economic activity."  We '
            "pause outside the derelict Queen's Market, which is being "
            "bulldozed. It's hoped a new food hall with flats and offices will "
            'be developed on the site through a mix of funding from the Welsh '
            'government, Denbighshire County Council, the levelling up fund '
            'and private businesses.  The plans would also see the town '
            'reconnected to the seafront. Incredibly, though an expansive '
            "sandy beach is just yards away, you can't see it from the high "
            'street.  Dr Davies says there is local backing. A master plan '
            'went out to consultation and has "the support of local councils, '
            'residents, businesses". But a potential obstacle is the number of '
            'high street shops owned by absentee landlords. A sample of Land '
            'Registry documents seen by BBC News show only five out of 25 High '
            'Street properties are owned by people local to Rhyl.  "That\'s a '
            'real challenge," Dr Davies acknowledges. "All you can do is '
            'invest in the areas that the local authority and willing partners '
            'own as a priority. And then you hope that economic activity will '
            'encourage others to follow over time." The BBC is tracking '
            "progress of the government's key levelling up policy in towns and "
            'cities around the UK. You can read more of our reporting from '
            'Rhyl here: How do locals out and about on a beautiful, bright '
            "winter's morning feel about their town centre and the plans to "
            'regenerate it?  "I\'m not quite sure how to put this. It\'s '
            'appalling," says a man who moved to Rhyl seven years ago. "Shops '
            "closing, shutting arcades. Rhyl just isn't what it used to be. I "
            'don\'t think it will ever come back."  But octogenarian former '
            'mayor, Diana Hannan, out on her mobility scooter, loves the town '
            'so much she moved back after emigrating to Australia. "We\'ve got '
            'the best seaside resort in Wales," she says.   "We get all this '
            'negative press about drugs and alcohol and all the rest of it, '
            "but we've got a lovely community living here. Rhyl is going to "
            'boom. You wait until all of these stores go up."  On the road out '
            'of town we stop off at a food bank run out of the back of the '

            'of "fabulous people". But he says "there\'s a lack of energy, a '
            'lack of enthusiasm". "There\'s this sense of hopelessness amongst '
            'the people. If you walk down the high street, you can just see it '
            'in people\'s eyes."  Mr Jones, who has lived in the town for more '
            'than 40 years, supports the levelling up plans but says the '
            'proposals "need to show the people of Rhyl that there is a hope '
            'and a future for them".  "It\'s OK to invest," he says. "But you '

            "Somerset Police's decision to refer this matter directly to the "
            'IOPC," said Mr Shelford.  Lloyds said Mr Shabir\'s allegations '

            'warning of an exodus from the NHS. The BBC has spoken to four '
            'midwives whose confidence in their employer has been shattered. '
            'Pamela Bischof , who has been an NHS midwife for 11 years, said '
            'she felt "stalked, bullied and harassed" with letters, emails and '
            'text messages telling her she would be sacked if she did not get '
            'vaccinated.  "It\'s a scandal," she said. "I felt under enormous '
            'pressure and it felt like being stalked, like I was being '
            'bullied. I felt harassed." She works in London, which until the  '
            'U-turn  was facing the biggest losses of any region in England, '
            'with nearly double the average numbers of unjabbed staff. Ms '
            'Bischof is a survivor of female genital mutilation and says the '
            'NHS\'s mandatory vaccine policy "threw me back" to a time when '
            'she was nine years old and "somebody was trying to force me to do '
            'something I didn\'t want to do". "Those emotions haven\'t gone '
            'away," she said. "I feel so, so badly treated that I\'m thinking '
            'of resigning, because it just made me feel worthless and like I '
            'was not a human being." This video can not be played She is one '
            'of more than 18,500 NHS London workers who were recorded as '
            'unvaccinated by the 3 February deadline, when dismissal '
            'proceedings were set to begin.  The 45-year-old from south London '
            'was taken off rotas beyond the deadline, despite "giving my all" '
            'to the NHS during the pandemic, and had already said her goodbyes '
            'to her patients, all of whom knew she was unvaccinated and still '
            'wanted her care. "I\'m a human being so I broke down and cried '
            'and they broke down and they cried," Ms Bischof said. "We\'re not '
            'being appreciated. "This situation just showed us there was '
            "really no point: I could work in Tesco or Sainsbury's and not be "
            'under the kind of pressure I was put under." Ms Bischof said she '
            'believed significant numbers of NHS staff were now "halfway out '
            'of the door", with some already training to work elsewhere. "I\'m '
            'going for my  doula training  next week and hypnobirthing '
            'training in two weeks," she said. "I don\'t see any reason why I '
            "should be put in that position with no support; there's really no "
            'point when I can do something for myself." Jade Moore , 40, from '
            'east London, has been a midwife for 13 years. She said her '
            'treatment had been "insulting" and so she was looking at taking '
            'her qualifications in aesthetics "off the backburner".  "I have '
            'hardly slept," she said. "I have given my heart and soul to the '
            'NHS so it\'s heart-breaking. "There are many people that have '
            'been planning ahead to look for other jobs."  A letter sent to '
            'NHS England bosses  sets out how managers had begun to prepare '
            'for "formal meetings" with staff from 4 February, although the '
            'NHS is now requesting managers do not serve notice of termination '
            'to employees affected by what it calls VCOD - vaccination as '
            'condition of deployment. The letter also states that the issue of '
            'VCOD remains subject to a parliamentary vote, and reiterates that '
            'vaccination is the best protection from Covid for "yourself, your '
            'family, your colleagues and, of course, your patients". Ms Moore '
            'said she believed there would "most definitely" be a significant '
            'number of people quitting the NHS, and not just the thousands of '
            'unvaccinated staff. She pointed out that there are many workers '
            'who have had the vaccination, but only because this was a '
            'condition of seeing relatives abroad or going on holiday. There '
            'are also those people who have chosen to change roles or leave '
            'the NHS entirely because of the  toll on their mental health over '
            'the past two years. Tamara Parker  said many NHS workers felt '
            '"they\'re out, they\'re done", even though bosses are now rowing '
            'back from the threat of mass dismissals. The 37-year-old from '
            'north London said that after 18 years as an NHS midwife putting '
            'informed patient consent first, she was not about to be '
            '"blackmailed" into getting vaccinated before she was ready.  She '
            'said: "This has really felt like a slap in the face, so quite a '
            'few are looking at alternative careers now." Ms Parker believes '
            'many within the NHS are looking for alternative work, "because '
            "they don't believe this has ended... they are just looking for a "
            'back door". Naimah Nicholls , 55, and from south London, has '
            'worked as an NHS nurse and midwife in a busy London hospital '
            'since 1986. She said that in the run-up to the deadline she '
            'experienced "extreme stress, crying every night and not being '
            'able to focus at work because I was under threat of losing my '
            'job".  Now, she said, her relief at the U-turn had turned to '
            'anger at being unsupported. She explained that she had lost her '
            'passion for the NHS. "It\'s not a place I want to work for much '
            'longer," she said. "I started making plans to leave because I had '
            'to, going into my own business as a doula. "A lot of people are '
            'angry and morale is at rock bottom, more so than ever before, '

            'Dickens by Mowbray Morris, manager of The Times, in 1859, '
            'apologising for the rudeness of a clerk who had rejected an '

            'team counts the number of birds daily. "After all the hard '
            'conservation work that has gone in over the years it is difficult '
            'to see this decline in the birds to such an extent." Dr Christine '
            'Middlemiss, UK Chief Veterinary Officer, has urged people who '
            'keep birds to avoid contact with those in the wild. "The absolute '
            'key action is about biosecurity, about being clean and making '
            "sure that there's no possibility of contact, either direct or "
            'indirect, between the wild birds and your kept birds," she added. '
            'David Brass, chief executive of the Lakes Free Range Egg Company, '
            'has kept his 130,000 birds in lockdown since November to protect '
            'them against avian flu. They produce about 10 million eggs a '
            'week.  He told the BBC how catastrophic it could be if the '
            'disease entered a shed of 32,000 birds, which are separated in '
            'two units. "Day one - 20 birds dead; Day two - maybe 60 to a '
            'couple of hundred. Once you get to day five there are none left - '
            'it\'s devastating," he said Under government guidelines eggs can '
            'still be labelled free range until mid-March. Mr Brass is hopeful '
            'the birds will be able to be released soon after, but returning '
            'them to lockdown next year is already on his mind "For the first '
            'few weeks it can be a real problem - they crowd around the '
            'pop-holes because they are wanting to be outside and they can '

            'Woollard, said: "It was an awkward time for us, we\'d only been '
            'able to open up outside, after the third Covid lockdown, so it '
            'was a fortuitous time to be shut, it brought a lifeline to us." '
            'She said it was a positive experience as filming "was great fun", '
            'and the pub walls were repainted. The TV series is an adaptation '
            "of bestselling writer Anthony Horowitz's crime thriller that was "
            'partially set in the county. Ms Woollard, who lives in the '
            'village, said, "It\'s going to be good for the pub and the '
            'village, and that\'s what everyone needs now.  "It\'s a stunning '
            'little village and it will be great to see it on TV."  She said '
            'it will bring in more tourists.  "The first episode of Lovejoy '
            'was filmed here, and people still come here because of that," she '
            "added. Jim Horsfield,  Screen Suffolk's  operations and business "
            'development manager, said they were contacted by Eleventh Hour '
            'Films who wanted to film a "quintessential Suffolk Village".  '
            'Several locations were looked at but Kersey, close to Hadleigh, '
            'was chosen.    "It\'s such a lovely village with so many period '
            'features, and once the art department had painted houses and '
            'placed period cars you feel transported to the 1950\'s," he said. '
            '"Filming like this brings considerable money into the district '
            'and gives local people the opportunity to work in the burgeoning '
            'film and TV industry in the county." The production company '
            'recently said 2021 was  its most successful year  when 240 days '

            'murders of Ms Russell and her six-year-old daughter in Kent in '
            'July 1996. His solicitor says he has now received a statement '
            'written by Levi Bellfield which details the killings. Stone was '
            "also found guilty of trying to murder Megan's sister Josie. He "
            'has always protested his innocence. His solicitor Paul Bacon says '

            'he claims to have carried out the attacks, including details of '
            'what he was wearing and how he made his escape. Mr Bacon read '
            'part of the letter to the BBC: "Something like this has never '
            'happened before. I committed a crime and another person has been '
            'arrested for it. "I guess if I\'m honest it was a relief. I '
            'apologise to Stone and to the Russell family for my heinous acts. '
            'I was not well in the head during my reign of violence. "I am '
            'willing to speak to the police."  Mr Bacon added: "I genuinely '
            'think if the police visit Levi Bellfield in prison, he will make '
            "a full statement under caution, and I believe if he's charged "
            'he\'ll plead guilty and the matter will be resolved." Lin Russell '
            'and her daughters Megan and Josie, then nine, were attacked as '
            'they walked along a country lane in Chillenden, before being '
            'bound, blindfolded and bludgeoned with a claw hammer. On the day '
            'of the murders, Dr Shaun Russell was told that he had lost his '
            'whole family. It was only when an officer at the scene noticed '
            'Josie move they realised she had survived the attack. Stone was '
            'first found guilty of two counts of murder and one of attempted '
            'murder in 1998 and again in 2001, after the Court of Appeal '
            'quashed his conviction due to doubts over a prosecution witness.  '
            'An application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in '
            '2010 was rejected and an  attempt to seek a judicial review of '
            'the decision also failed  in 2011. Bellfield is currently serving '
            'a life sentence for the murder of 13-year-old Millie, who went '
            'missing from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002. He has also been '
            'convicted of murdering Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange, '
            'and of the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, and will never be '
            'considered for parole. The alleged confession will now be '
            'referred to the CCRC. Last year Mr Bacon said a shoelace found  '
            'at the scene of the murders - and which was missing until it was '
            'found in police storage in 2020 - could provide vital DNA '
            'evidence. Det Ch Sup Paul Fotheringham, of Kent Police, said: '
            '"Following two trials at which Stone was found guilty by a jury '
            'on both occasions, and an appeal to the High Court, Michael Stone '
            'remains convicted of the murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and '
            'the attempted murder of Josie Russell in 1996. "Michael Stone '
            'made an application to apply for a Judicial Review in respect of '
            'his conviction in September 2012. The Honourable Mr Justice Blake '
            'ordered that permission for the application should be refused. '
            '"The Criminal Case Review Commission commenced an extensive '
            're-examination of the murder investigation in 2017 and has had '
            'access to all forensic evidence, documentation and exhibits from '
            'the original investigation, the review by Hampshire Police, '
            'details of the two crown court trials and appeals to the High '
            'Court. "The shoelace which was seized as part of the original '
            'investigation was made available to the CCRC. All evidence from '
            'the examinations on the shoelace were recorded and disclosed to '
            'the CCRC." A spokesperson for the CCRC said: "Mr Stone\'s current '
            'application is being reviewed and we remain in regular contact '
            'with his legal representatives. "We are aware they are planning '
